# About Me

<img src="blogs/web.assets/naiyufang_main.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="560">

Here is **Naiyu Fang (房乃玉)**.


I am a fifth-year PhD student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shuyou Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0092066) and [Prof. Lemiao Qiu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/english_my_freetown). Our research Group is affiliated to [the State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power & Mechatronic Systems](http://sklofp.zju.edu.cn/sklen/) and [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html). 

My reserach interest focuses on Computer Vision, Autonomous Driving, and Virtual Try-on.

I will graduate at June 2024. Now, I'm looking for a postdoc position. My email is FangNaiyu@zju.edu.cn

## Research Interests

- Computer Vision
- Autonomous Driving
- Virtual Try-on

<br>

**-Visual-only autonomous driving upstream tasks:** It centered on the precision and efficiency issues in camera image-based perception of surrounding scenes. I have conducted the semantic segmentation task of vehicle and road on bird’s-eye view plane, and an efficiency-oriented cue fusion task for multi-frame monocular depth estimation.

**-Image-based virtual try-on visual tasks:** It revolved around visual realism and representation form issues. I have proposed a progressive pipeline of virtual try-on, a learning paradigm of garment transfer through cross-task knowledge
distillation, an unsupervised synthesis method of garment images, and an image sequence inference method via pose interpolation.
