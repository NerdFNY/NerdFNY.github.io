## Research Interests

- Computer Vision
- Autonomous Driving
- Virtual Try-on

<br>

**-Visual-only autonomous driving upstream tasks:** It centered on the precision and efficiency issues in camera image-based perception of surrounding scenes. I have conducted the semantic segmentation task of vehicle and road on bird’s-eye view plane, and an efficiency-oriented cue fusion task for multi-frame monocular depth estimation.

**-Image-based virtual try-on visual tasks:** It revolved around visual realism and representation form issues. I have proposed a progressive pipeline of virtual try-on, a learning paradigm of garment transfer through cross-task knowledge
distillation, an unsupervised synthesis method of garment images, and an image sequence inference method via pose interpolation.
